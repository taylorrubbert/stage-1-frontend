          An urban redevelopment plan is underway in Lumiose City! The goal: to
          turn it into a place Pokémon and people can truly share. Shortly after
          arriving, you’ll choose from one of these partner Pokémon to accompany
          you on your journey – Chikorita, Tepig or Totodile. Together, you can
          explore the streets of this vast city or visit Wild Zones – habitats
          where you’ll encounter wild Pokémon. To catch them, aim carefully and
          throw a Poké Ball or take them on with the help of the Pokémon on your
          team. Set to release 2025

        <h2 className="news__subtitle">Pokemon Cafe Remix</h2>
        <p className="news__text">
          Pokémon Café Mix has received some sweet enhancements and a new title:
          Pokémon Café ReMix! In this free-to-start puzzle game, you’ll befriend
          Pokémon and complete puzzles to create wonderful drinks and dishes to
          serve at your Pokémon Café. Solve puzzles by linking matching Pokémon
          icons to clear them from the screen. Each puzzle has a set of
          objectives, so think carefully before making your move. As your café
          menu grows, new recipes will bring new ingredients. Stay on the
          lookout for ingredients appearing on the puzzle board, and try new
          tactics to clear them all. Your café is staffed by hard-working
          Pokémon—and they’re always eager to help! Use their special Café
          Skills to help clear the puzzles. Eevee will be the first Pokémon on
          your staff when you open your café, but by solving puzzles and
          creating delightful Pokémon-themed café offerings that are almost too
          adorable to eat or drink, you’ll soon have more Pokémon joining you!
          The more you play, the more your café will grow with new areas and
          upgrades. As you serve yummy drinks and dishes to your Pokémon
          customers, you’ll build friendships with them. Once you’ve reached a
          high enough level of friendship with a Pokémon, it’ll join your café
          staff. Keep developing your café, and new Pokémon will be inspired to
          visit! With multiple game modes to choose from, you can dish out tasty
          treats in a variety of different ways. Recruit specific Pokémon by
          preparing additional orders, challenge completed orders to earn more
          stars, work with your Pokémon partners to develop new menu items, and
          more. There are new events, outfits, and gimmicks to discover, so head
          to your Pokémon Café and make something delicious! Pokémon Café ReMix
          is available for download now. Visit the official site for details!
